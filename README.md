# TextFS
## Purpose
This is a little **Python**-made program that doesn't use graphics since I don't know how to.
This program can take data from a user-imported aircraft file and a location file.
Then, it'll take the data and simulate the physics, while printing the **data** out in a user-specified repeat time.
**In data, in the previous sentence, I meant like position data in accordance to the center of the map, and speed (velocity), vertical speed, engine throttle & power, etc.**
I hope someday, people are able to help me with the accuracy of simulation.
And that someone will be able to use the data that's printed out as variable DATA in output.
The DATA variable is rewritten everytime the output is refreshed to **output.py** in /Output/

## Developers
This is a self maintained project by SoHiEarth, and was started on May 10th, 2023. The first version was version **a0.0.1**. 

## Releases
There are **3** channels.\
\
**Stable** - Stable is equipped with the most stable version of TextFS. This may get the least updates (excluding stablitity and bug fixes) and features,
         as it is supposed to be the most stable and the "Long Term Support" version of TextFS.\
### Latest Release for **Stable**
**a0.0.1** 
\
**Nightly** - This is the bleeding edge of in-development TextFS versions. It is not meant to be stable, and critical errors and bugs.
          Still, this is the one with the most feature updates and cool new stuff. If you like new stuff, try using this.
          Though, I recommend that you have a different more stable version of TextFS if you don't like seeing error messages and crashes.


## Implementations
If you would like to use TextFS into your program, just have a license.txt file that has the following text, and feel free to customize TextFS, or just use it plainly as a engine.\
### Latest Release for **Nightly**
**a0.0.12**\
"\
**This is program uses TextFS version [insert version # here (etc. 0.0.1,0.0.11)] developed mainly by SoHiEarth.**\
"\
Thanks, we don't take any royalties.

## Installation
**Program is not finished**
cd into the folder and then start main.py with
```
python3 -m main.py
```
You will need Python 3.9 or higher.

## Features that aren't Implemented **Yet**
Main gameplay, output, shutdown stage.

## For the Future
Planning for some more text-based projects.\
**TextEngine** \
Can simulate physics and handle positioning.\
**TextML**\
Can analyze a large dataset and recognize patterns.\

## Ideas
Feel free to comment any ideas to Discord *Coming Soon*
