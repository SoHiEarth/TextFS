# TextFS-b0.0.1
## Purpose
This is a little **Python**-made program that doesn't use graphics since I don't know how to._
This program can take data from a user-imported aircraft file and a location file._
Then, it'll take the data and simulate the physics, while printing the **data** out in a user-specified repeat time._
**In data, in the previous sentence, I meant like position data in accordance to the center of the map, and speed (velocity), vertical speed, engine throttle & power, etc.**_
I hope someday, people are able to help me with the accuracy of simulation._
And that someone will be able to use the data that's printed out as variable DATA in output._
The DATA variable is rewritten everytime the output is refreshed to **output.py** in /Output/_

## Developers
This is a self maintained project by SoHiEarth, and was started on May 10th, 2023. The first version was version **a0.0.1**. _

## Releases
There are **3** channels.

**Stable** - Stable is equipped with the most stable version of TextFS. This may get the least updates (excluding stablitity and bug fixes) and features,_
         as it is supposed to be the most stable and the "Long Term Support" version of TextFS._
### Latest Release for **Stable**
**Beta** - Beta isn't as stable as Stable, but has many new features that are from the Nightly channel,_
       which have been deemed to be stable enough to go to further testing. It can be said that this is_
       the one with the best balance between stability and features._
### Latest Release for **Beta**
**b0.0.11**_
**Nightly** - This is the bleeding edge of in-development TextFS versions. It is not meant to be stable, and critical errors and bugs._
          Still, this is the one with the most feature updates and cool new stuff. If you like new stuff, try using this._
          Though, I recommend that you have a different more stable version of TextFS if you don't like seeing error messages and crashes._


## Implementations
If you would like to use TextFS into your program, just have a license.txt file that has the following text, and feel free to customize TextFS, or just use it plainly as a engine._
"_
**This is program uses TextFS version [insert version # here (etc. 0.0.1,0.0.11)] developed mainly by SoHiEarth.**_
"_
Thanks, we don't take any royalties._

## Features that aren't Implemented **Yet**
Main gameplay, output, shutdown stage._

## For the Future
Planning for some more text-based projects._
**TextEngine** _
Can simulate physics and handle positioning._
**TextML**_
Can analyze a large dataset and recognize patterns._

## Ideas
Feel free to comment any ideas to Discord *Coming Soon*_
